## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared components:

### Frontend Architecture (Maintained)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture (Refactored to Python)
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with FastAPI framework
- **Language**: Python with async/await support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with HTTPBearer
- **File Processing**: Python multipart with pandas, openpyxl, PyPDF2
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API + OpenAI API for document processing
- **Migration**: Alembic for database schema management

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` directories for code organization
2. **TypeScript Throughout**: Full type safety across frontend, backend, and shared schemas
3. **Shared Schema**: Common data types and database schema definitions in `shared/` directory
4. **AI-First Architecture**: LangGraph orchestration for multi-agent workflows
5. **Serverless Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for scalability and reduced operational overhead

## Key Components
