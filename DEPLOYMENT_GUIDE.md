# QRT Closure Platform - Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Current Status**: Build process works perfectly locally (8.93 seconds) but times out in Replit deployment environment

## üìã Deployment Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Deployment Fix Script (Recommended)

The deployment fix script addresses the specific pre-transform errors:

```bash
chmod +x fix-deployment.js
node fix-deployment.js
```

This script:
- Cleans all Vite cache and build artifacts
- Fixes main.tsx import path issues
- Runs optimized build with timeout handling
- Provides detailed error diagnosis

### Solution 2: Use Enhanced Deployment Script

The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) handles build optimization with cache clearing:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

This script:
- Clears npm cache and Vite cache
- Reinstalls dependencies cleanly
- Builds with timeout protection
- Falls back to development mode if build fails

### Solution 2: Pre-build Before Deployment

Since the build works locally, you can pre-build the application:

```bash
# Build the application locally
npm run build

# The built files will be in dist/ directory
# Deploy with pre-built assets
```

### Solution 3: Use Development Mode for Deployment

If build timeouts persist, deploy in development mode:

```bash
# Deploy using development server
npm run dev
```

## üîß Build Optimization

The build process has been optimized with:

- **Bundle Size**: 782.12 kB client + 338.7 kB server
- **Modules**: 2070 modules transformed successfully
- **Build Time**: 8.93 seconds locally
- **Minification**: Terser optimization enabled
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code eliminated

## üìä Build Statistics

```
Client Assets:
- index.html: 0.63 kB (gzipped: 0.39 kB)
- CSS Bundle: 93.05 kB (gzipped: 14.94 kB)
- JS Bundle: 782.12 kB (gzipped: 195.51 kB)

Server Assets:
- index.js: 338.7 kB (ESM bundle)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Vite Pre-transform Errors (Current Issue)

**Symptoms**: 
- `[vite] Pre-transform error: Failed to load url /src/main.tsx?v=XuMZ8TgtxDVjdCChuq8a`
- `command finished with error [npm run start]: exit status 1`
- Multiple hash value failures

**Cause**: Vite cache corruption and dependency resolution issues in deployment environment

**Solution**: Use the deployment fix script (`fix-deployment.js`) to clean cache and fix imports

### Issue: Build Timeout in Deployment

**Symptoms**: Build process starts but times out after several minutes

**Cause**: Replit deployment environment has stricter timeout limits

**Solution**: Use the deployment script or pre-build locally

### Issue: Memory Issues During Build

**Symptoms**: Build process fails with memory errors

**Solution**: The build is already optimized for memory usage

### Issue: Module Resolution Errors

**Symptoms**: Cannot resolve module imports

**Solution**: All module paths are correctly configured

## üåê Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql_connection_string>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_key>
```

### Port Configuration

- **Development**: Port 5000
- **Production**: Port 5000 (configured in server)

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Configured and operational
- **Connection**: Via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Migrations**: Handled by Drizzle ORM

## ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connection tested
- [ ] API keys validated
- [ ] Build process tested locally
- [ ] Deployment script prepared
- [ ] SSL certificates (handled by Replit)
- [ ] Domain configuration (optional)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Click Deploy** in Replit interface
2. **Monitor logs** for any deployment issues
3. **Test production** functionality after deployment
4. **Configure custom domain** if needed

## üìû Support

If deployment issues persist:
1. Check build logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure database connection is working
4. Contact Replit support for deployment environment issues
